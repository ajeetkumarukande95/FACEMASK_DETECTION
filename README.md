# FACEMASK_DETECTION
Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning

Overview
This project implements a face mask detection system using deep learning techniques. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system can accurately identify whether a person in an image is wearing a face mask or not. It provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and obtaining real-time predictions.

Features
Real-Time Prediction: Quickly determine if a person in an image is wearing a face mask.
Simple Interface: Easy-to-use interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.
High Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy in face mask detection through deep learning models.
Shareable Link: Generate shareable links to easily share predictions with others.
Debug Mode: Built-in debug mode for developers to test and troubleshoot.
